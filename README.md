Android Basics Nanodegree - Project 4 Music Player

This is a very basic structure of a music player app. It has a menu, and from the menu you can access a list of songs. This list of songs has titles and artist names, but doesn't play any music.

This project utilizes the following:
- onClick listeners
- ListView
- Menu with TextViews and dividers

I plan on coming back to this project to improve the UI, and implement actual music playability once I learn how. For now, this project meets submission guildelines for the nanodegree.
